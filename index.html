      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Foundation models and large language models (LLMs) represent a transformative advancement in healthcare and biomedical research, offering a new paradigm for understanding complex health systems. These large-scale models are pretrained on extensive datasets encompassing various health data types, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks such as disease prediction, medical image analysis, and health monitoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite these advances, most existing foundation models and LLMs in healthcare focus on a single modality, such as medical images, electronic health records, or genomic data. However, human health is inherently multimodal, with complex interactions spanning different physiological systems and data types.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address these limitations, there is a growing need for multimodal foundation models that can effectively integrate and reason over diverse health signals. These models need to align heterogeneous data types, handle missing or noisy modalities, and support clinically meaningful interpretations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This workshop will bring together researchers working at the intersection of multimodal learning, foundation models, LLMs, and healthcare to discuss recent advancements, explore methodological innovations, and identify key challenges in designing multimodal foundation models for health signals.
