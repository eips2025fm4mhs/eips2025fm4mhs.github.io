          <p>My research is focused on developing novel time-series representation learning approaches with graph modelling and explainability for complex health problems. I work directly with clinical collaborators globally to build AI systems that try to help improve or save lives. I also like to think about the bigger picture of how we integrate these models, what it means to 'explain' an AI decision, and how we make them more trustworthy in clinical practice. I have international collaboration experience across the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and the US and Canada regions and have helped host and been hosted by AI researchers and labs globally.</p>

          <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford (Junior Research Fellow, Kellogg College) working at the intersection of AI for Healthcare and AI for Social Good, with a focus on foundation models for electronic health records (EHRs), time-series and survival modeling with uncertainty quantification, population-scale multimorbidity profiling, and knowledge-graph–driven learning. I have 40+ publications with 1,500+ citations across KDD/WWW/AAAI/IJCAI/SIGIR and serve on program committees for NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD (Outstanding Reviewer 2025), AISTATS, WWW, and LoG, as well as a reviewer for Nature Communications and IEEE TPAMI. I bring a proven track record in community building and event delivery, including leading a well-attended tutorial on knowledge graph and its applications at ACM SIGSPATIAL (>300 attendees) and coordinating invited seminar series and talks.</p>

          <p>My research focuses on modelling electronic health records (EHRs) as event streams, with a particular emphasis on rare diseases and personalised strategies. I aim to improve diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis outcomes in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios by leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained large language models. Beyond technical interests, I am motivated by a desire to improve the well-being of patients with rare conditions and to work toward more equitable access to healthcare through AI.</p>

          <p>My research focuses on bridging the gap between theoretical algorithms and their deployment in real-world settings for healthcare applications. I am particularly interested in advancing multimodal and cross-modal learning, continual and few-shot learning, and the development and adaptation of foundation models for wearable biosignals.</p>
